# python_framework
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, Bootstrap, SQL and so on.

Learning Projects Repository
This repository is a collection of my work created while learning various web development and programming technologies. It includes projects and experiments using Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and more. Each folder contains a different project or exercise that demonstrates a specific concept or skill I've practiced.

Technologies Used
Python (Flask): For backend web development.
HTML & CSS: Structuring and styling web content.
JavaScript: Adding dynamic interactivity to websites.
Bootstrap: Implementing responsive, mobile-first designs.
Purpose
This repository serves as a portfolio of my progress and learning. The projects included here vary in size and complexity, from simple "Hello World" applications to more intricate web applications. I will continuously update this repo as I learn and experiment with new concepts.
